# Migration Scripts - README
## CAUTION: Use at your own risk!

These migration scripts are provided as-is and should be used with caution. Before executing the scripts, make sure to review and understand the code to ensure it aligns with your specific requirements and environment.

## Compatibility
Please note that APIs and CLI commands may vary or change between different versions of Plesk, CyberPanel, and CloudPanel. It is recommended to review and modify the scripts accordingly to match the versions you are using.

Make sure to test the scripts in a non-production environment first and have proper backups of your data to mitigate any potential risks or data loss.

## Prerequisites
Before running the migration scripts, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Access to the source server (Plesk server) with the necessary permissions to retrieve files and databases.

2. SSH key for connecting to the source server securely.

3. Temporary FTP user and password with appropriate permissions to access and download files from the Plesk server.

4. PHP version supported by the destination server (CyberPanel or CloudPanel).

5. Output directory for storing downloaded files and databases.

## Instructions

To use the migration scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the migration script to your local machine.

2. Open the script file in a text editor.

3. Review the script and ensure that the configuration variables (such as server details, PHP version, file paths, etc.) are correctly set for your environment.

4. Update any other necessary variables or settings, such as email addresses, account/package details, and database passwords.

5. Save the changes to the script file.

6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script file is located.

7. Run the script using the appropriate command. For example, if the script file is named `transfer_cyberpanel.sh`, you can run it by entering `bash transfer_cyberpanel` in the terminal or command prompt.

8. Follow the prompts and provide the required information when prompted by the script.

9. Wait for the script to complete the migration process. The duration of the migration may vary depending on the size of the files and databases being transferred.

10. Once the migration is complete, review the output and logs generated by the script to ensure that there are no errors or issues reported.

11. Verify that the migrated websites are functioning correctly on the destination server (CyberPanel or CloudPanel).

`Note: It is important to thoroughly test the migrated websites and ensure that all functionalities are working as expected.`
